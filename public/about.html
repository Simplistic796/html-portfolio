<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I come from Tinley Park, Illinois not the biggest of towns. Growing up I had a love for gaming, sports, and computers. 
  I wanted to always learn how things work and ended up pursuing  a career in Software Engineering, a soon to be data too!
  I had seen many good things about this course and gave it a try for $20 and it hasnt disappointed!
